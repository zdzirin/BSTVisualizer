# BSTVisualizer

An application for visualizing binary search trees.
Programmed in java using javax.swing to create the gui elements.

Comes with an executable jar file to try the application.


A quick explanation of the code...

* Mozart is the file the program runs from.

* Gooey controls the gui, while screen handles mouse input

* NodeArray handles the functions of the binary search tree, adding removing and organizing the tree. If I was to go back and improve this project I would implement the BinarySearchTree itself as a class, rather than manipulating an array with this class.
* Node, point and circle all handle the nodes and their representation on screen.
